# StoneSoup Performance Toolkit 

This Repository is a collection of load testing and chaos testing scripts written in Golang, using the Go Dog framework for load tests and simple Go scripts for chaos tests. This toolkit is being used to test the performance and resilience of a system called StoneSoup.

The load testing scripts in this repository are designed to simulate real-world usage patterns of the StoneSoup system and determine how it performs under different levels of user traffic. The chaos testing scripts, on the other hand, intentionally introduce failure scenarios in the StoneSoup system in order to determine its ability to withstand and recover from unexpected events.

This repository is an example of the use of modern DevOps practices, as it helps organizations identify and fix potential problems in the StoneSoup system before they cause production issues. The scripts are designed to help teams ensure the stability and reliability of the StoneSoup system.
